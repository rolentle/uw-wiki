title: Kus'lorian Republic
---

Native to the broiling planet Vastra, the Kus'lorians predate human existence. With humanoid features, the species adapted an intricate cooling system to regulate their body temperature by having glands scattered across their body. Unlike the traditional human male and female anatomy, the Kus'lorian males are more elaborate and feminine in appearance while the females are simplistic and masculine.

## The Kus'lorian Biocide

For centuries, the Kus’lorians survived and technologically advanced to the point where [FTL](faster-than-light) travel was accessible. With [FTL](faster-than-light) technology, the Kus'lorians colonized other worlds. However, the Kus’lorian Republic noticed a slight decline in population. Through scientific research, they discovered a global cooling ravaging Vastra’s climate. Within 2 generations 15% of the population was unsuccessful to procreate. With many tests and experiments, the scientists uncovered an unknown virus afflicting the reproductive organs. Alarmed, the Republic funded the project to develop a cure and closed off all [FTL](faster-than-light) transportation to the other colonies for they had messages indicating the virus had spread. As exponentially more Kus’lorians were affected, the society was thrown into disarray and despair, until finally they found the origin of the virus.

Dubbed the Psionetrosis, this organism lied in stasis unable to reproduce because of Vastra’s sweltering temperature. Vastra’s cooling environment provided ideal conditions for the virus to infect the race. With their inability to purge the virus and 69% of the population infected, the Republic launched scientific and diplomatic vessels in search of a cure.

## The Amalgamation

During a council meeting, Ambassador Yorvik proposed an exchange of technology for human genetics. With majority of the Republic agreeing to his suggestion, they tasked a diplomatic committee to carry out the mission. Upon offering the colonists Kus’lorian technology for human genetic material, the humans were unwilling to share their DNA. Undenounced to the humans, the desperate Kus’lorians secretly acquired human DNA for testing. They found the hybrid Kus’lorian-Human to be a viable solution. Now armed with the knowledge of human compatibility, the diplomats returned promising [FTL](faster-than-light) technology in exchange for human genetic material. Unable to resist, the humans agreed, but with stipulations. Stipulations being:

* No Biological Weaponization
* No Human Cloning
