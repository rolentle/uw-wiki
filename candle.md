## Squad Leader Report

Candle is dumber than scrap metal, but that boy can fly. He can run circles around anyone else in the squadron, then you ask him a basic question and it's like talking to toddler. And like every other brat from Eden, he hadn't ever seen a gun let alone shot one. We eventually just had to put B.I.G. rockets on his ship so he couldn't miss.

He is a good hand overall, but ain't making leadership anytime soon. For such a small brain, the kid has a pretty big heart. He is willing to listening to anybody who talks to him and he always pitching in the kitchen or engineering bay.
