The smallest and least populous of [Eden](eden)'s eleven moons.

* Mean radius: 465 km
* Surface gravity: 0.94 g

Crag's surface is rugged and rocky, made up of many layers of slate and similar metamorphic rocks. Because of these uniformly exposed layers, it is thought that the moon was once volcanically active, although it shows no signs of being active currently.

The weather on Crag is chaotic, with frequent small thunderstorms and violent windstorms. The abundance of liquid water along with the moon's slick surface combine to make it a treacherous venture on foot. There are only two "major" roads on Crag, but they see almost no regular traffic.

Crag's atmosphere is thick enough to contain many gases, but holds too high a concentration of oxygen to be breathable directly for prolonged periods of time.

## Crag Station

The sole public settlement on Crag is also the only independent market within [Eden](eden)'s star system. Crag Station is a luxurious set of markets that houses unique goods from the ["human side" of Standard Space](standard-space#human-side), and accordingly regularly draws very diverse clientele.

### [7/105.4] Attack

In local mid-afternoon on [7/105.4], an explosion erupted at the South Docks of Crag Station. As shoppers fled the south market in the direction of the central atrium, groups of unidentified soldiers emerged from the docks and made their way through the marketplace. A significant number of [VSCorp](vscorp) soldiers were already located at the station, and quickly engaged the force.

Nearly an hour of fighting continued until local [Eden](eden) security forces arrived at the station, cautiously and carefully securing the settlement.

#### Aftermath

Hours after the attack, [Eden](eden) officials called the incident an "act of terrorism". The number of civilian casualties was unclear, but authorities are estimating as high as 200.

Most residents of [Eden](eden) viewed the involvement and escalation of violence by [VSCorp](vscorp) as a primary cause of the level of carnage, and as a result, the [Eden](eden) government has placed heavy trade sanctions on [VSCorp](vscorp) until thorough investigations are completed.
