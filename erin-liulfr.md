> "I know! We'll have some sort of signal! A distress signal! (gasps) Can you imitate a boolagr?"

As a happy-go-lucky, sociable and playful woman, Erin is mainly characterized by her boundless enthusiasm, changing her personality according to her mood. She is more insightful than one would think and is capable of being serious when mostly necessary. She can be found socializing with her companions, causing mischief, and tactical training.

With her mother a Lieutenant Commander in the [Galactic Navy](galactic-navy) and her father an executive biotechnician in [VSCorp](vscorp), Erinâ€™s life was filled with combat tactics, experiments, and simulations. Splitting her time between these two facilities, Erin had no real ambition toward anything. Life was a game and the game soon became monotonous. Discovering the prospect of adventure, she left only a datapad for her parents and boarded the [Proteus Maru](proteus-maru) as their Security Operative.
