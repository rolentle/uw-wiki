> "The galaxy needs people like me. When shit breaks, I fix it. Starship captains, pilots, pirates all have one thing in common. They're only as good as their ship is. They may be ace pilots but without us those heaps are little more than inert hunks of metal, avionics, & electronics. Call it a symbiotic relationship. You fly it and I'll fix it."

Though not the most tactful of individuals he is loyal to the core, never leaving his friends in a lurch. He'd rather be reading the latest technical manual than socializing, but he does enjoy spending time at the nearest local dive bar. While cramped quarters may be unsettling to most he knows little else.

Theodore grew up on the underground facilities of New London. Life was simple, albeit cramped. You had two basic career paths: miner or foundry worker. Even at a very young age, Teddy knew he wanted a way out. When a recruiter showed up he wasted no time signing up. He spent the better part of the next five years attached to 453rd squadron of the [Galactic Navy](galactic-navy). Now he serves as chief engineer/technician aboard the [Proteus Maru](proteus-maru), where one day he hopes to earn enough to buy a plot of land on a distant frontier planet and settle down.
