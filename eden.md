## Genesis

Once _Salvation_ landed on Eden, the colonists explored the planet's lush fields and beautiful forests. They floated beautiful rivers full of never before seen fish walked through jungles with a new bird, bug, and fauna around every corner.

## The Land of Milk and Honey

Eden's soil was perfect. Every seed from ship planet grew when sowed by the solarbots. The local vegetation was delicious as well, but even better was when the scientist started cross pollinating them. After spending a lifetime on the ship, the taste of an apple mixed with a prickleberry was to die for.

## The Shining City Upon a Hill

Humanity had a second chance on Eden, its people lived knowing that. They celebrated through art, music, and food. From their plays to their sculptures, eveyday was meant to be cherish. With solarbots doing most of the work, there was always time for leisure.

However, Eden would not make the same mistakes as Earth had. As written and told by their forefathers from Earth, the first colonists formed a democracy and from this government a better way would be created. They avoided overpopulation by instituting a two children policy. They would prevented pollution by forcing everything to be solar power, despite evidence of other energy sources below the ground. They would avoid the temptation of war by preventing weapons to be created in mass quantities.

## The Tree of Knowledge

Times had changed. Eden was no longer an isolated utopia and now had to be a player in galactic society. The government has loosened laws so that they could begin trading food for tech and weapons. The faction's key scientists have grown resentful having not been the ones to discover FTL first and have begun investing their time into more "aggressive" technology. Many citizens are nervous of how vulnerable they are to attack and how much they have to rely on the Galactic Navy for aid.

Some in the Capital, Plymouth, believe it is time for Eden to live up to its promise and begin to "unify" Humanity. Others want to stay isolated from the other factions.
