## Project Ascension

Upon hearing whispers of Earth's desire for galactic colonization, Elijah vas Shaedör conceived and planned Project Ascension, Vas Shaedör Corporation (VSCorp) most significant initiative yet. The mission of Project Ascension was to seek out advancement in health, transportation, energy, technology, terraforming, security, and cybernetics. VSCorp endeavored to discover vital knowledge no matter the cost. Thus in 2162, VSCorp built and launched the SS Ascension amongst the stars. For 4 generations, the star ship drifted through space until detecting an alien planet.

## First Contact

Detecting breathable atmosphere, the colonists begin to settle and survey the local flora and fauna. When the colonists entered Vastra's atmosphere, the Kus'lorians detected their presence on their sensors, however, did not make any contact. Instead as the colonists established habitation modules, the Kus’lorians observed their activities and eventually sent ambassadors to meet with the newly arrived humans. Although initial communication was difficult, the two races were able to coexist through the combined effort of translator implants. However, not all of the Kus’lorians were welcoming of the human colonists.

## Vas Shaedör Corporation

After [the Amalgamation](kuslorian-republic#the-amalgamation), relations between the humans and Kus’lorians have been stabilized. The hybrids dubbed New Kus’lorians have integrated into both societies. Those that refuse human genetics have gradually dwindled in numbers.

With great hope, VSCorp crew is now a mix of human, Kus’lorians, and New Kus’lorians. Equip with FTL tech,they set their sights on scientific discovery. Their new mission is to share FTL and their knowledge, but for a price.

: Upon discovering [Sheoul Prime](sheoul-prime), VSCorp rescued the colonists from annihilation. After sharing FTL tech and building a contract, the two factions have friendly relations. Amazed at the new world, some of the New Kus’lorian decided to stay on the planet to expand their race.

After reuniting with each faction, VSCorp continues to expand their technological advancement to the far reaches of the galaxy.
