## Project Ascension

Upon hearing whispers of Earth's desire for galactic colonization, Elijah vas Shaedör conceived and planned Project Ascension, Vas Shaedör Corporation (VSCorp) most significant initiative yet. The mission of Project Ascension was to seek out advancement in health, transportation, energy, technology, terraforming, security, and cybernetics. VSCorp endeavored to discover vital knowledge no matter the cost. Thus in 2162, VSCorp built and launched the SS Ascension amongst the stars. For 4 generations, the star ship drifted through space until detecting an alien planet.

## The Kus'lorian Biocide

Native to the broiling planet Vastra, the Kus'lorians predate human existence. With humanoid features, the species adapted an intricate cooling system to regulate their body temperature by having glands scattered across their body. Unlike the traditional human male and female anatomy, the Kus'lorian males are more elaborate and feminine in appearance while the females are simplistic and masculine.

For centuries, the Kus’lorians survived and technologically advanced to the point where FTL travel was accessible. With FTL technology, the Kus'lorians colonized other worlds. However, the Kus’lorian Republic noticed a slight decline in population. Through scientific research, they discovered a global cooling ravaging Vastra’s climate. Within 2 generations 15% of the population was unsuccessful to procreate. With many tests and experiments, the scientists uncovered an unknown virus afflicting the reproductive organs. Alarmed, the Republic funded the project to develop a cure and closed off all FTL transportation to the other colonies for they had messages indicating the virus had spread. As exponentially more Kus’lorians were affected, the society was thrown into disarray and despair, until finally they found the origin of the virus.

Dubbed the Psionetrosis, this organism lied in stasis unable to reproduce because of Vastra’s sweltering temperature. Vastra’s cooling environment provided ideal conditions for the virus to infect the race. With their inability to purge the virus and 69% of the population infected, the Republic launched scientific and diplomatic vessels in search of a cure.

## First Contact

Detecting breathable atmosphere, the colonists begin to settle and survey the local flora and fauna. When the colonists entered Vastra's atmosphere, the Kus'lorians detected their presence on their sensors, however, did not make any contact. Instead as the colonists established habitation modules, the Kus’lorians observed their activities and eventually sent ambassadors to meet with the newly arrived humans. Although initial communication was difficult, the two races were able to coexist through the combined effort of translator implants. However, not all of the Kus’lorians were welcoming of the human colonists.

## The Amalgamation

During a council meeting, Ambassador Yorvik proposed an exchange of technology for human genetics. With majority of the Republic agreeing to his suggestion, they tasked a diplomatic committee to carry out the mission. Upon offering the colonists Kus’lorian technology for human genetic material, the humans were unwilling to share their DNA. Undenounced to the humans, the desperate Kus’lorians secretly acquired human DNA for testing. They found the hybrid Kus’lorian-Human to be a viable solution. Now armed with the knowledge of human compatibility, the diplomats returned promising FTL technology in exchange for human genetic material. Unable to resist, the humans agreed, but with stipulations. Stipulations being:

* No Biological Weaponization
* No Human Cloning
* No ?

## Vas Shaedör Corporation

After the Amalgamation, relations between the humans and Kus’lorians have been stabilized. The hybrids dubbed New Kus’lorians have integrated into both societies. Those that refuse human genetics have gradually dwindled in numbers.

With great hope, VSCorp crew is now a mix of human, Kus’lorians, and New Kus’lorians. Equip with FTL tech,they set their sights on scientific discovery. Their new mission is to share FTL and their knowledge, but for a price.

[Sheoul Prime](sheoul-prime)
: Upon discovering [Sheoul Prime](sheoul-prime), VSCorp rescued the colonists from annihilation. After sharing FTL tech and building a contract, the two factions have friendly relations. Amazed at the new world, some of the New Kus’lorian decided to stay on the planet to expand their race.

After reuniting with each faction, VSCorp continues to expand their technological advancement to the far reaches of the galaxy.

## Achievements

* KorvinTek, a subsidiary of VSCorp, is the primary starship manufacturer. It orbits Vastra’s main moon Thalya.
* Cryosleep was perfected by Dr. Okhalla. She created the MedPod-146a, a medical cryosleep chamber.
* EcoSuits i183 was built by a collaboration between human scientist Dr. Kelper and kus'lorian technician Daplorth. It is the current advanced space suit used in exploration, reconnaissance and tactical maneuverability in the field.
