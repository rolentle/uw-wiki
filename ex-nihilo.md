## A World in Our Image

Those in charge of the faction ship from Oceania refused to let chance dictate what world their future generations would live on. Long before the final blueprints for their faction ship was ever finalized, Ex Nihilo was underway starting their new life. Thousands of "New Start" rockets were just the beginning. These interplanetary missiles were filled with a modified cyanobacteria. These bacteria sat dormant over the many light years it traveled until the heat of impact reawakened it. The target of this aggressive terraforming was a desolate rock orbiting a yellow dwarf with a roughly 24 hour night day cycle. [SDSSp J153259.96-0039744](sileo) was to be a perfect new Earth.

## Bringing the Earth

While the other faction ships were getting ready to depart, Ex Nihilo's ship, _Terrum Veteris_, was still in construction. As more and more humans left earth, Ex Nihiloâ€™s scientists and workers picked through the remains of the left behind factions and gathered what little flora and fauna was left on Earth. The massive Terrum Veteris was designed to not only transport human members of Ex Nihilo but also to bring along the Earth with them. Over half the ship was dedicated space for self-contained ecosystems. These ecosystems were to restart life on [SDSSp J153259.96-0039744](sileo) which had now been named [Sileo](sileo).

## Trouble on Terrum Veteris

The slow departure and bulky design of the ship ended up causing more problems than the leaders of Ex Nihilo expected. While the extra births that occurred during the ships delay easily fit within the dedicated living space of the massive faction ship, after one generation space was getting crowded. After two generations people began getting restless. When the third generation heard that the other faction ships had begun to land and colonize their new planets things got out of hand. Unrest caused the break down of several of the ecosystem pods. With people moving into the newly found space, tensions eased but a strange and unique market arose. Animal skins became a symbol of wealth and non-modified meats a delicacy for those who could afford it. When the ship finally landed a clear divide between the have and the have nots was evident and tensions were back to a high.

## The Start of the New World

With the landing of the faction ship the class divide was finalized. The atmosphere on Sileo had been seeded but it still several hundred years from being completely breathable. This as planned for and atmospheric scrubbers allow for areas directly near them to be habitable. While the lower class formed a sprawling city with the use of the atmospheric scrubbers, the elite stayed on Terrum Veteris where no modification to the air is needed. Sileo is crowded world were unrest is frequent but it may just be the last place in the galaxy to get a decent hamburger.
