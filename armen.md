Armen was a strangely dressed, middle-aged man that the [Proteus Maru](proteus-maru) crew encountered and interacted with while spending time at [Crag Station](crag#crag-station).

## Introduction

[CANDLE](candle) was originally approached by Armen at a bar inside the central atrium of [Crag Station](crag#crag-station). Armen wore a distinctive feathered coat, and spoke in a foreign-sounding accent. He requested that the crew of the [Proteus Maru](proteus-maru) deliver a unit of unspecified cargo to a frontier planet [Horus](horus). The crew agreed, and were further requested to supply transport for Armen and "an associate" to the planet as well.

## Death

As [violence broke out at the station](crag#attack), [CANDLE](candle), Armen, and [Want](alexander-flintlock#companions) attempted to make their way to the [Proteus Maru](proteus-maru), but were stopped by a force of [VSCorp](vscorp) soldiers securing the area. As [CANDLE](candle) engaged in melee with the soldiers, a [VSCorp](vscorp) officer drew his laser pistol and assassinated Armen.
