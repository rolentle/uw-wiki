## An Unfortunate Beginning

[Sheoul Prime](sheoul-prime) is the less than fortunate landing place of the colony ship _Europa_. The initial years of colonization were brutal, to be kind. The planet is often wracked by violent sandstorms making travel and communication virtually impossible. The colonists were forced underground where a vicious insectile predator known as the Sheoul Pit Roach makes it's home. Where their ancestors had largely overcome the tribalist nature of past generations, they quickly devolved into factions. Were it not for the return of the as of yet unknown human brothers and sisters their fate would have been sealed.

[Sheoul Prime](sheoul-prime) is a quite mineral poor when it comes to metals. What it lacks in minerals it makes up in Xalataen crystals. Firstly thought to be a semi-precious gemstones, they would one day be a valuable commodity to the galaxy. Xalataen crystals are the primary component used in laser fabrication. Though were of little help to the earliest settlers.

## A Faction Begins

Post reunification a great deal of Sheoulites left never to return. Some learned the true value of the once-worthless crystals and began to capitalize upon the largely ignored deposits. It wasn't long before inter-factional disputes turn into a bloody conflict known as the Crystal Wars. Peace was finally settled when a charismatic leader by the name of Markus Toth united the divided factions into what we now call the Toth Cartel.

## Current Day

Modern day [Sheoul Prime](sheoul-prime) is largely only underground mining facilities and remains one of the prime sources of Xalataen crystals. Efforts to terraform the planet have not been successful. Although, one planet-side habitation does exist, the domed resort known as Brimstone. It lies in a mountain valley shielded from the sandstorms in the northern hemisphere. Rumors abound that Sheoul Prime is a haven for pirates amd criminals and sometimes is referred as the "Pirate Planet". Direct involvement of buccaneers with the Cartel have never been substantiated.

An impressive station lies in high orbit over [Sheoul Prime](sheoul-prime). Part market, part administrative office and part residence Sheoul-1 is a bustle of activity.

The Toth Cartel boasts a sizable mercenary fleet rivaling the Galactic Navy and pride themselves in containing any internal conflict without involving other factions.
