The systems, planets, moons, and space stations populated by the modern human population is widely known as "Standard Space". The various systems are all linked by a complex network of jump gates, in a stable configuration such that the routes between the gates are safe for warp travel.

## "Human Side"

The area of Standard Space furthest from the [Kus'lorian](kuslorian-republic) populated systems is colloquially termed the "human side". The worlds in this large swath of stars are less densely populated, but are much more spread out and explored in general than the near-[Kus'lorian](kuslorian-republic) systems.
