title: Faster Than Light
---

Faster than light technology, commonly shortened to *FTL*, allows entities (primarily starships) to travel through space faster than the speed of light.

## Jump Travel

The primary, most understood method of FTL travel utilizes *Jumpspace*, another spacial dimension which allows instantaneous travel between two points in real space. Knowledge of Jumpspace originates from the [Kus'lorians](kuslorian-republic), who shared this knowledge with humanity as part of [the Amalgamation](kuslorian-republic#the-amalgamation).

In order to traverse this dimension, specially-designed engines called *Jump drives* are commonly used. In theory, a Jump drive alone can travel anywhere in physical space you'd want to go. In practice, the requirements for precise data, the structure of the Jumpspace itself, and the desire for safe and predictable travel mean that Jumps are usually performed between fixed Jump points. Systems are connected by chains of these points, allowing safe, if time-consuming travel.
